<h4>Curation and quality assurance of environmental research data for the use case of global land
    use&nbsp;data<br />Kuration und Qualitätssicherung von Geodaten in der Umweltforschung am Beispiel globaler
    Landnutzungsdaten</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nowadays, a huge part of the environmental sciences refers to data driven research.
    Numerous interdisciplinary projects and research alliances&nbsp;produce data, but there is no standardized and
    common procedure for quality assurance and curation of the research data. The BMBF project GeoKur aims to support
    the curation and quality assurance already during the research process and not only when the research data are
    finally published. The developments include approaches for</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The research objectives of GeoKur throughout the life cycle of research data</p>
<p><span style="color: #2f4f4f;"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These time series are not only relevant for many sub-fields&nbsp;of
    the&nbsp;environmental and sustainability-related sciences​ (e.g.,&nbsp;food production,
    biodiversity&nbsp;conservation, water and resource availability, economic development), but also represent
    characteristic challenges for data curation, quality assurance and the provision of a consistent data basis for
    environmental research. These issues have not been solved comprehensively yet. The recommendations and guidelines,
    developed in GeoKur will be provided as lightweight tutorials, but also as transferable open source software tools.
    All data and software products of GeoKur will be made available to the research community.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Duration:</strong><br />The project started on 1 June 2019 and will run for 3 years.<br />Grant
